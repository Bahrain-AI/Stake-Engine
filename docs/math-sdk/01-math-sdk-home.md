## Stake Engine - Software Development Kit: Math SDK

### Why Use the Math SDK?

Traditional slot game development involves complex mathematical models requiring significant time and resources. The SDK provides:

- **Customizable templates** and sample games to expedite development
- **Simulation capabilities** with discrete outcome probabilities for precise control
- **Output formatting** compatible with Carrot RGS for production deployment
- **Built-in multithreading** and optimization for large-scale simulations

### Who Is This For?

Target users include developers seeking to:

- Build slot games with distinctive mechanics
- Refine payouts and hit rates through optimization
- Generate simulation outputs for statistical review
- Launch games on Stake.com efficiently

### Static File Outputs

Unlike real-time RNG systems, Stake Engine requires predetermined outcomes. Games generate an ordered list of critical game details such as symbol names, board positions, payout amounts.

Output consists of two components:

1. **Game logic files** — containing game details
2. **CSV payout summaries** — with simulation data

The system allows exact calculation of the game's RTP and essential win-distribution statistics at time of publication.

### Key Features

- Predefined frameworks with customizable templates
- Mathematical precision for simulating and optimizing win distributions
- Seamless integration with the Carrot RGS
- Scalability with built-in multithreading and optimization tools
